This folder contains 3 additional Jupyter notebooks. Parts VII and VIII peform import Mojo Box Office data on the top 300 films
in terms of inflation-adjusted box office revenues. The code merges the Box Office data with the 1936-2017 IMDB dataset
(i.e., from Parts II-III). Finally, more advanced data visualizations are implemented: barplots of aggregations, boxplots, 
and scatterplots. 

Part IX implements more advanced data anaysis methods, such as linear regression models, via the Statsmodels library, and lineplots
of the data over time to examine trends in film length, metascores, and IMDB ratings.
