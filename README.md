Web crawler using beautifulsoup library; data cleaning, statistics, and analysis using Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn 

This repository comprises several Python scripts that implement (among other things): a web crawler that extracts the first 
5 pages of IMDB films data for each year during a long range (e.g., 1936-2017) from the IMDB site.
